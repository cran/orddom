Changes to Version 3.0. (2012-04-21)
+ New function dmes to easily calculate nonparametric effect size measures independently from orddom
+ Easier and more reliable input possible (vectors, lists, arrays, data frames) (by means of new function return1colmatrix)
+ Individual variable label and test descriptions can now be assigned
+ Outputs now also contain Number Needed to Treat (NNT) effect size
+ (Para)metric Common Language effect size McGraw & Wong (1992) added
+ Metric d CI in orddom now based on Hedges & Olkin (1985)
+ Elimination of negative delta-between variance estimates for paired comparisons
+ Correction of symmetric CI for independent Cliff's delta statistics
+ New function dmes.boot to calculate bootstrap-based CI for nonparametric effect size measures and Cohen's d,
+ dmes.boot was largely based on R code provided by J. Ruscio and T. Mullen (2011) reused with kind permission
+ New function delta_gr now yields a graphical and interpretational output for Cliff's delta statistic
+ New options for one- and two-tailed CI in orddom and orddom_f, resulting in changes of rows 21+22 of independent and rows 18+19 of paired orddom result matrix
+ Metric t: t, p and df can now be calculated and embedded in orddom as standard or Welch approximated

Changes to Version 2.0 (2012-02-17)
+ orddom now also accepts simple vectors as x or y
+ New orddom_f() function file allows for file output of statistics for multiple sample comparisons (e.g. csv or analyses in MS Excel or Open Office Calc).
+ New orddom_p() function file allows for detailed tab-formatted output for single sample comparisons.
+ Package dependency on compute.es package suspended (tes-Function for metric Cohen's d in orddom).
+ New metric_t() function for additional information on metric t-test results.
+ The dm() function can now also return difference matrices.
+ Improved stability of orddom function as well as minor corrections (e.g. PS Indep Samples) in orddom output and manuals (e.g. labeling of experimental and control groups).

Changes from orddom Version 1.0 (2010-12-28) to 1.5(2012-01-04)
+ Calculation of CI and delta z-score-estimates can now be based on Students t-distribution rather than using fixed normal distribution z-scores.
+ Symmetric CIs can now be obtained to increase power of the delta statistics in certain cases.
+ Formulas used for calculation added in orddom manual.
+ Probability of Superiority statistic as well as variance estimates for delta in the independent groups analyses were corrected.
+ Minor changes were implemented to allow for calculation of \eqn{d = \pm 1}{d=+-1} extreme cases without error abort.
+ Output of raw y-dataset in independent group analysis was corrected.
+ Dependencies on packages \emph{psych} and \emph{compute.es} declared in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files.
