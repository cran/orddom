Changes to Version 2.0 (2012-02-17)
+ orddom now also accepts simple vectors as x or y
+ New orddom_f() function file allows for file output of statistics for multiple sample comparisons (e.g. csv or analyses in MS Excel or Open Office Calc).
+ New orddom_p() function file allows for detailed tab-formatted output for single sample comparisons.
+ Package dependency on compute.es package suspended (tes-Function for metric Cohen's d in orddom).
+ New metric_t() function for additional information on metric t-test results.
+ The dm() function can now also return difference matrices.
+ Improved stability of orddom function as well as minor corrections (e.g. PS Indep Samples) in orddom output and manuals (e.g. labeling of experimental and control groups).

Changes from orddom Version 1.0 (2010-12-28) to 1.5(2012-01-04)
+ Calculation of CI and delta z-score-estimates can now be based on Students t-distribution rather than using fixed normal distribution z-scores.
+ Symmetric CIs can now be obtained to increase power of the delta statistics in certain cases.
+ Formulas used for calculation added in orddom manual.
+ Probability of Superiority statistic as well as variance estimates for delta in the independent groups analyses were corrected.
+ Minor changes were implemented to allow for calculation of \eqn{d = \pm 1}{d=+-1} extreme cases without error abort.
+ Output of raw y-dataset in independent group analysis was corrected.
+ Dependencies on packages \emph{psych} and \emph{compute.es} declared in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files.
